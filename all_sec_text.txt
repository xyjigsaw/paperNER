Approximately 190 Galactic X-ray sources are classified as low mass X-ray binaries
The properties of the accreted crust can be probed observationally in quasi-persistent transiently accreting neutron stars. These systems accrete continuously for years to decades, before accretion turns o and the source switches from outburst to quiescence. Despite the 2每5 order of magnitude drop in luminosity, modern X-ray telescopes can detect these systems in quiescence. The observed soft X-ray component is typically interpreted as thermal emission from the crust heated by nuclear reactions during the outburst
Constraints on the physics of neutron star crusts and dense matter in general have been derived from these observations through comparison with models that account for all relevant nuclear processes. Examples include the finding of a relatively high thermal conductivity indicating a relatively well-ordered lattice structure of the solid crust
The steady-state compositional profile of the outer layers of the neutron star is mapped out by the compositional changes of an accreted fluid element as it is incorporated deeper and deeper into the neutron star. These compositional changes are the result of a series of nuclear processes that occur with increasing density. Within hours of arrival on the neutron star, at around 106 g/cm3, hydrogen and helium burn into a broad range of heavier elements up to Z 48. The reaction sequences are the 3 reaction, the hot CNO cycles, the p-process, and the rapid proton capture process (rp-process)
The nuclear reactions in the crust of accreting neutron stars, and the associated nuclear heating, were first calculated by
In this work, we carry out the first full reaction network calculation of the compositional changes in accreted neutron star crusts through neutron drip and into the first pycnonuclear fusion reactions. We follow a broad range of individual reactions and also account for nuclear shell structure. This provides the full picture of nuclear transformations governing the transition from the outer crust to the inner crust. There are a number of open questions that we aim to address: (1) What are the nuclear reaction sequences in the neutron star crust for a realistic multicomponent composition when allowing for branchings and competition between di erent types of rates? (2) Is the crust evolving towards equilibrium, once free neutrons are available for neutron capture reactions to produce heavier elements, as suggested by

The crust model used here is similar to that in
In order to track the time evolution of the nuclear abundances, Yi, an implicitly solved nuclear reaction network is used that includes electron captures, -decays, neutron capture, neutron dissociation, and pycnonuclear fusion reactions. The nuclear heat dQ deposited in a time step t is obtained as dQ = P idYi edYe ndYn dWL with atomic mass excesses i, electron chemical potential (without rest mass) e, neutron chemical potential (without rest mass) n, electron fraction Ye, neutron abundance Yn, neutrino energy losses from electron captures and beta decays , and lattice energy WL
Unless otherwise stated, we use m步 = 0:3m步 Edd in the rest frame at the surface, with the local Eddington accretion rate m步 Edd = 8:8 104 g cm 2 s 1, and g = 1:85 1014 cm s 2. This accretion rate is in the range for mixed H/He bursts powered by the rp-process as well as superbursts and is therefore appropriate for the initial compositions explored in this work. The calculation starts at a density of = 1:4 109 g cm 3. The temperature is treated as a free parameter and set to T = 0:5 GK throughout the crust. This corresponds closely to the temperature profile used in
Nuclear masses are among the most important input parameters. We use the Atomic Mass Evaluation AME12
In general, mass models for isolated nuclei such as the FRDM are not applicable in the inner crust, where interactions with the free neutrons result in significant modifications of masses and nuclear structure. However, the goal of this work is to calculate the nuclear reactions in the outer crust and the transition from the outer crust into the inner crust. We stop the calculations in the outermost region of the inner crust below = 2:7 1012 g cm 3 before such modifications become significant. While the neutron mass fraction at the end of our calculation is Xn = 0:52, the neutron Fermi energy is 1.4 MeV, and the free neutron density is only 9 10 4 fm 3, less than 1% of the neutron density inside a nucleus.

We performed calculations of the compositional evolution in the accreted crust for di erent initial compositions. The initial composition is determined by the nuclear ashes of thermonuclear burning near the neutron star surface, which is expected to vary from system to system depending on companion star composition, accretion rate, and neutron star mass. We use here four sets of ashes: a pure 56Fe ash composition to facilitate comparison with previous work by Haensel 56Fe 56Cr 56Ti 56Ca 56Ar 46Si 40Mg
62Ar 54Ar, 58Ca 61Ca & Zdunik (1990), predictions for the ashes of extremely hydrogen rich X-ray bursts powered by an extended rp-process
3.1. Reaction sequence for initial 56Fe composition We begin by discussing in detail the reaction sequences for an initial composition of pure 56Fe. Our calculation follows the compositional change in an accreted fluid element as density and therefore electron chemical potential e are slowly rising. The evolution of the main composition as a function of depth is shown in Fig. 2 and the major compositional transitions are listed in Tab. 1. Xnd The initial reaction sequence up to e = 15:6 MeV and = 8:1 1010 g cm 3 takes 2:3 1010 s and is characterized by a series of three, two step, electron capture (EC) reactions 56Fe(2EC)56Cr, 56Cr(2EC)56Ti, and 56Ti(2EC)56Ca described already in
At e = 23:3 MeV and = 2:9 1011 g cm 3, the destruction of 56Ca by electron capture occurs. However, this step proceeds entirely di erently owing to the rising significance of free neutrons (see Fig. 3). These neutrons are released in the second step of the two step electron capture sequence, which proceeds as 56Ca(EC)56K(EC,2n)54Ar. The neutron separation energy of 56Ar is su ciently low for most of the EC transitions from 56K to proceed to neutron-unbound states leading to the emission of neutrons. The released neutrons are recaptured by the most abundant nucleus, which is still 56Ca, leading to a neutron capture sequence to 58Ca. The reaction path therefore splits into two branches leading to 54Ar and 58Ca, respectively. However, branchings between electron capture and neutron capture at 57Ca and 56K divert some of the reaction flow to 56Ar via 57Ca(EC)57K(EC,n)56Ar and 56K(n, )57K(EC,n)56Ar, respectively. The result is a three nuclide composition, dominated by 56Ar, but with admixtures of 58Ca and 54Ar at about 0.2% mass fraction each.
This admixture is, however, short lived, as at e = 25:9 MeV and = 4:2 1011 g cm 3, 58Ca and 54Ar are converted into 56Ar (Fig. 4). The destruction of 58Ca proceeds via 58Ca(EC,1n)57K(EC,1n,2n,3n), resulting in a range of Ar isotopes, which, together with the already existing 54Ar, are quickly transformed into 56Ar by neutron capture. At this log Y -7.0 -6.5 -6.0 -5.5 -5.0 -4.5 -4.0 point, the crust is rather pure and mainly composed of 56Ar. reaction sequence occurs when the neutron emission following an electron capture leads to a nucleus with jQECj e, which therefore immediately captures electrons again and so on. In this particular case, an SEC leading from 56Ar all the way to 40Mg is established. The detailed reaction sequence is shown in Fig. 5 and is characterized by electron captures with the emission of mostly 4每5 neutrons. The released neutrons are recaptured by 56Ar, which is still the most abundant nuclide. This leads again to a split of the reaction path into the SEC from 56Ar to 40Mg and a sequence of neutron captures from 56Ar to 62Ar. In the initial phase of the SEC, there is a significant abundance buildup of 50S produced by neutron capture from the SEC path, and to a lesser extent of 42Si. However, with only a slight rise of e, electron capture quickly destroys these isotopes and they are converted into 40Mg as well. The end result is a layer that consists primarily of 62Ar (80% mass fraction) and 40Mg (20% mass fraction). There is a small admixture of 59Cl (10 5 mass fraction). The free neutron abundance is significantly increased to 4.8 10 5.

via 62Ar(EC,3n)59Cl(2n, )61Cl(EC,11n)50S (Fig. 6). At 50S, four destruction paths carry significant flow: (EC,3n), (EC,4n)46P(n, ), (EC,5n)45P(2n, ), and (4n, )54S(EC,7n) all leading to 47P, which then undergoes a (EC,5n) reaction leading to 42Si (N = 28). At this point the neutron abundance has reached Yn = 0:23 (Fig. 7) and this considerable neutron density results in a significant neutron capture branch that drives reaction flow out of N = 28 into 48Si. However, 42Si(EC,n) is not negligible and results in an additional build up of 40Mg via 42Si(EC,n)41Al(EC,3n and 4n)37;38Mg(2-3n, )40Mg. As a consequence, 40Mg increases significantly in abundance. After the destruction of 62Ar is complete, the layer consists of 46Si (44% mass fraction), 40Mg (32% mass fraction) and 28 30 capture cascade (SEC)
The destruction of 62Ar coincides with the onset of a weak reaction flow through the first pycnonuclear fusion reaction, 40Mg+40Mg!80Cr (Fig. 6). The fusion reaction is immediately followed by a rapid SEC sequence leading back to 40Mg and establishing a pycnonuclear fusion-SEC cycle (Fig. 6). The net e ect of the cycle is a 40Mg+40Mg!40Mg+40n reaction resulting in the conversion of 40Mg into neutrons with increasing depth. 46Si is the only significant bottle neck in the cycle besides 40Mg and maintains a significant, roughly constant abundance while reactions produce and destroy the isotope.
At e = 37:1 MeV and = 1:7 1012 g cm 3, 46Si begins to be depleted significantly. However, because of its location in the fusion-SEC cycle, its abundance is initially not dropping to zero but is merely reduced to about 10 4. At this depth, 40Mg electron capture begins to initiate a SEC sequence towards lighter nuclei (Fig. 8). This SEC sequence ends at 25N where the pycnonuclear fusion reaction 25N+40Mg!65K (not visible in Fig. 6 because the flow is too weak) dominates over further electron capture. The resulting 65K is immediately destroyed by a reaction sequence that merges into the SEC of the 40Mg+40Mg main pycnonuclear fusion-SEC cycle. An additional branching occurs at 28O, where EC is comparable to 28O+40Mg!68Ca fusion. Again, the resulting 68Ca does not accumulate but merges into the main SEC. EC on 40Mg therefore e ectively leads to a branching of the reaction flow into a two pycnonuclear fusion sub-cycles. The e ect of all these cycles is the same 40Mg+40Mg!40Mg+40n net reaction converting one 40Mg nucleus into neutrons on each full loop. The first significant depletion of 40Mg (Fig. 2) marks therefore the onset of significant pycnonuclear fusion.
At a slightly larger depth, at e=37.2 MeV, = 2:4 1012 g/cm3, P = 3:9 1030 dyne/cm2 and y = 2:1 1016 g/cm2 abundance builds up at the edge of our network and we stop the calculation. The neutron mass fraction has reached 46%. The calculations indicate, though, that the next step is the conversion of N = 28 40Mg into 44Mg as a consequence of the increasing neutron density. Deeper fusion-SEC cycles develop then starting on 44Mg. While 44Mg is not magic, it is the preferred nucleus at these higher neutron densities, because of the jump in neutron binding from Na to Mg predicted by the FRDM mass model leading to an extension of the neutron drip line by 8 isotopes (see, for example, Fig. 8).
For X-ray bursters that do not exhibit superburst burning, the ashes of the rp-process is the appropriate initial composition for the crust processes. We use here the composition calculated by the X-ray burst model of
Urca pair 105Zr - 105Y 103Sr - 103Rb 103Zr - 103Y 98Kr - 98Br 96Kr - 96Br 31Mg - 31Na 93Sr - 93Rb 93Rb - 93Kr 99Sr - 99Rb 97Rb - 97Kr 99Rb - 99Kr 97Kr - 97Br 29Mg - 29Na 55Ti - 55Sc 31Al - 31Mg 93Y - 93Sr 6:40 2:19 1:16 8:38 8:72 1:10 1:60 3:80 3:58 4:99 6:40 5:58 3:94 3:96 nature, the model serves as a useful tool to explore the consequences of a maximally extended rp-process that reaches the Sn-Sb-Te cycle. We ignore elements lighter than neon assuming they are destroyed by residual helium burning and other thermonuclear fusion processes near the surface.
The initial compositional evolution is characterized by sequences of electron capture reactions along chains of constant mass number (Fig. 10). In this shallow region, the original composition as a function of mass number is preserved and simply pushed to more neutron rich nuclei. In some cases, decay is not completely blocked creating a local nuclear Urca cycle
12
At around e = 10:3 MeV and = 2:36 1010 g cm 3 the first neutrons are created. These neutrons are immediately recaptured by nuclei in other mass chains. The further evolution is therefore characterized by a combination of EC reactions that drive the composition more neutron rich, and neutron capture reactions that deplete some mass chains, and enhance others. Fig. 10 shows the reaction sequences up to the point where neutrons first appear. The first neutrons are created by 88Rb(EC,n)87Kr, which competes with 88Rb(EC)88Kr. The reason that neutron emission can occur relatively close to stability is that EC on 88Rb is predicted to occur through a relatively high lying excited state in 88Kr at Ex =6.9 MeV. This is a consequence of the proximity of the N = 50 neutron shell closure (88Rb has N = 51) resulting in spherically shaped nuclei and EC strength distributions that are concentrated in a few states
The first fusion reactions are initiated relatively early at = 1:2 1011 g cm 3 and e = 17:5 MeV (Fig. 11). Previously, 20O produced by EC processes from the initially abundant 20Ne, has been partially converted by neutron capture into 21O. As soon as 21O undergoes an EC transition to 21N, 21N+21O and 21N+21N fusion reactions occur. Slightly deeper at = 1:3 1011 g cm 3 and e=18.0 MeV, two EC transitions on the remaining 20O produce 20C, triggering 20C+20O, 20C+21N, and 20C+20C fusion reactions. Other fusion reaction combinations, including reactions involving 22O produced by neutron capture from 21O, also occur but are an order of magnitude weaker. At somewhat higher = 1:92 1011 g cm 3 and e = 20:4 MeV, the pycnonuclear fusion of oxygen becomes possible. 24O, produced 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 by electron captures from the initially present 24Mg, with some contribution from 21O neutron captures, is destroyed via 24O+24O. With this reaction, all oxygen is destroyed, leaving neon as the lightest element present in the crust.
At = 3:78 1011 g cm 3 and e = 25:2 MeV nuclei in most reaction chains have reached the neutron drip line (Fig. 11). The free neutron abundance is still low with Yn=1:1 10 13. This is su cient however to drive the composition into a (n, )-( ,n) equilibrium within each isotopic chain. Note that the neutron Fermi energy EFn kT at this stage. Overall, neutron capture reactions have significantly altered the composition as a function of mass number. In particular, abundances in most odd A chains have been drastically reduced, the only remaining odd A nucleus with a significant abundance is 89Cu (Section 4.1.2).
Beyond = 3:78 1011 g cm 3 and e = 25:2 MeV, SEC chains begin to play a role and rapidly convert nuclei along the neutron drip line into lighter species until a particularly strongly bound nucleus with a large EC threshold is reached (Fig. 12). The associated release of neutrons leads to a drastic 22 = 2:4 increase of the free neutron abundance, marking the location of neutron drip.
Neutron captures also drive the abundance in the neon isotopic chain, predominantly originating from initial 28Si in the burst ashes, into 32Ne and 34Ne. At = 7:7 1011 g cm 3, pycnonuclear fusion reactions set in and destroy 32Ne and 34Ne. The most important reactions are 34Ne+34Ne, 32Ne+34Ne, 34Ne+24O, and 34Ne+20C. 24O is produced via 32Ne(EC,n)31Na(EC,8n)23O(n, )24O. 20C is produced from 24O via 24O(EC,2n)22N(n, )23N(EC,5n)18C(2n, )20C.
All these processes are essentially completed at = 1:28 1012 g cm 3 and e = 33:6 MeV, at which point the composition is concentrated in a few nuclei at N = 82 (116Se, abundance Y=4:4 10 4), at N = 50 (70Ca Y=1:0 10 2, near N = 28 (46Si, Y=2:6 10 4), and at N = 28 (40Mg, Y=8:4 10 5). The neutron abundance has reached Yn = 0:21 (Fig. 7) and EFn has reached 0.62 MeV, exceeding kT 40 keV resulting in degenerate neutrons. The abundance accumulated at the three locations where the neutron drip line intersects the neutron numbers N = 28; 50, and 82 can be mapped to di erent mass ranges in the initial composition. N = 82 is mostly produced from initial A 106 nuclei, with some contribution from A = 102 105. The initial A 106 abundance is 7:5 10 4, already larger than the final N = 82 abundance. The main branch points that govern leakage to lighter nuclei for A 106 material are 106Kr and 104Se. At 106Kr, neutron capture moves material towards N = 82, while EC feeds 104Se via a (EC)( ,n)(EC,n) sequence. At 104Se, (EC,n) moves material ultimately to N = 50, while neutron capture feeds N = 82. The final N = 82 abundance may be increased by a small contribution from A = 102 105. The key branchings are 102Se and again 104Se, where in each case the EC branch moves the abundance towards N = 50.
A 56 nuclei are mostly converted into nuclei near the N = 28 region. A = 56 is the borderline case, and the reaction sequence is similar to the pure 56Fe case discussed in section 3.1. An isolated exception is the initial 28Si abundance which in part ends up in the N = 50 region due to fusion reactions: 28Si is converted into neon isotopes via ECs. At 28Ne neutron capture competes with 28Ne(EC,n). The 28Ne(EC,n) branch leads to fluorine and then oxygen, which then fuses into nuclei in the sulfur region. However, a significant fraction of the initial 28Si abundance is processed through the 28Ne(n, ) branch leading to neutron rich neon isotopes, which then fuse into calcium, and ultimately end up in 70Ca (N = 50). Initial elements lighter than silicon fuse into nuclei below calcium and are therefore converted into N 28 nuclei. Initial elements heavier than silicon but lighter than iron end up as magnesium or silicon isotopes, which do not fuse until much greater depths, when nuclei are su ciently neutron rich for SECs to prevent accumulation at N = 50. 42 40

We continue the simulation beyond = 1:25 1012 g cm 3 and e = 33:6 MeV to = 2:5 1012 g cm 3 and e = 37 MeV, at which point the increasing neutron density drives the composition towards the edge of our reaction network. At = 2 1012 g cm 3 and e = 35:1 MeV N = 50 70Ca is destroyed by a SEC and converted into nuclei in the N = 28 region, leaving only the N = 28 and N = 82 regions with significant abundance. We also see the onset of significant 40Mg+40Mg fusion, resulting in a similar fusion-SEC cycle as discussed in section 3.1.
Fig. 14 shows the calculated time integrated nuclear energy production. The various drops indicate significant cooling from nuclear Urca pairs in the outer crust. Indeed, the location of the top three pairs listed in Tab. 2 coincides with the major drops visible in Fig. 14 around = 2:2 1010 g cm 3, = 3:2 1010 g cm 3, and = 6:4 1010 g cm 3. ) u / V e ( 1 M y g r e n e ra0 e l c u n -1109
A more typical estimate of the final composition of mixed H/He bursts is provided by calculations using the 1D multizone code KEPLER. We use the model described in more detail in
The evolution of the composition with increasing depth is overall very similar to the extreme rp-process ashes case, though the di erent mass chains have di erent relative abundances due to the di erent initial composition (Fig. 16). The main global di erence is a shift of the appearance of significant amounts of free neutrons towards higher densities by about 50%, which is more in line with the calculation for pure 56Fe ashes (Fig. 7). This is due to the much reduced abundance of heavy (A > 72) nuclei that tend to reach the neutron drip line at shallower depth and lead to an early release of neutrons in the case of the extreme rp-process ashes. The deeper onset of neutron drip has some consequences for the further evolution of the composition. In particular, when the heavier mass chains reach the neutron drip line, the neutron abundance is lower, and the equilibrium nucleus is therefore closer to stability where electron capture thresholds are lower. SEC cascades therefore set in earlier, compared to the case of extreme rp-process ashes where nuclei are pushed to more neutron rich isotopes that require higher e to capture electrons (Fig. 17). This, together with the much lower initial abundance of A > 103 nuclei leads to a negligible production of N = 82 nuclei. The final composition after SECs have converted the composition into nuclei at or near closed shells or with large single particle energy level gaps is 70Ca (N = 50, Y =8:5 10 3), 46Si (N = 32, Y =1:24 10 3), and 40Mg (N = 28, Y =6:4 10 3) with a neutron abundance of Yn = 0:092.
Again we can map these final abundances to the distribution by mass number of the initial composition. As in the case of the extreme rp-process ashes, A 56 is the approximate dividing line between material ending up in N = 50 and near N = 28. However, because of the lower free neutron abundance nuclei tend to be less neutron rich and have lower EC thresholds. Therefore, in the case of the KEPLER X-ray burst ashes, there is some leakage from the A = 58 60 mass chains towards the N = 28 region, primarily due to branch points where neutron capture competes with EC such as 59Ca(EC),60Ca(EC,n), and 62Ca(EC,3n). While the abundance that remains in the Ca isotopic chain is ultimately converted into N = 50 70Ca, any leakage to lighter elements feeds the N = 28 region. As in the case of the extreme rpprocess ashes, the initial 28Si abundance is fed into the Ca isotopic chain and converted to 70Ca. Indeed, the sum of the initial abundances of 28Si and A > 60 is 9:5 10 3 mol/g exceed the produced N = 50 abundance slightly, indicating that most of the other nuclei end up near N = 28.
At depths beyond = 1:10 1012 g cm 3 (y = 1:27 1016 g cm 2) the evolution is essentially the same as in the case of the extreme rp-process ashes (see section 3.2). The nuclear energy release is overall similar (Fig. 14), though there is somewhat stronger nuclear Urca cooling, and a slightly higher nuclear energy generation. The dominant 36 Urca pairs are listed in Tab. 3. Compared to the extreme rpprocess ashes there are two additional important Urca pairs in lighter mass chains, 33Al-33Mg and 65Fe-65Mn. The lack of shallower cooling from heavier nuclei is more than o set by the very strong cooling from 31Mg-31Na at around = 1 1011 g cm 3 (Fig. 14). This is due to the much larger initial abundance of A = 31 nuclei (9:1 10 5 vs 4:9 10 6).
In some X-ray bursting systems, rare superbursts may further modify the composition at a depth around = 1 109 g cm 3
The final composition shown in Fig. 20 has been determined at the same e as Fig. 17 and demonstrates that in10-1 deed the same nuclei are populated. Because this composition is reached at a greater depth, it is much closer to the onset of pycnonuclear fusion of 40Mg. However, the relative population of 40Mg (Y=9:1 10 3), 46Si (Y=8:7 10 3), and 70Ca (Y=3:2 10 4) is di erent because of the di erent initial composition. Most of the abundance is concentrated around N = 28 with only a smaller N = 50 contribution from 70Ca. Because the initial composition has only a small amount of A > 60 nuclei (Y=8 10 8 mol/g), the only contribution to N = 50 comes from parts of the initial A = 60 and A = 28 abundances (see discussion in section 3.2). Again the competition of neutron capture and EC at 60Ca and 28Ne, respectively, is critical in determining the relative distribution of N = 28 and N = 50 nuclei in the inner crust.
In crusts with initial superburst ashes, Urca cooling is comparable to the case of extreme rp-process ashes (Fig. 14), however, cooling comes almost exclusively from the 55Sc55Ti pair. All other Urca cooling pairs are at least a factor of 50 weaker. Heating is significantly higher than for either of the X-ray burst ashes cases.
For X-ray bursters that do not exhibit superburst burning, the ashes of the rp-process is the appropriate initial composition for the crust processes. We use here the composition calculated by the X-ray burst model of

We ignore elements lighter than neon assuming they are destroyed by residual helium burning and other thermonuclear fusion processes near the surface.
The initial compositional evolution is characterized by sequences of electron capture reactions along chains of constant mass number (Fig. 10). In this shallow region, the original composition as a function of mass number is preserved and simply pushed to more neutron rich nuclei. In some cases, decay is not completely blocked creating a local nuclear Urca cycle
12
At around e = 10:3 MeV and = 2:36 1010 g cm 3 the first neutrons are created. These neutrons are immediately recaptured by nuclei in other mass chains. The further evolution is therefore characterized by a combination of EC reactions that drive the composition more neutron rich, and neutron capture reactions that deplete some mass chains, and enhance others. Fig. 10 shows the reaction sequences up to the point where neutrons first appear. The first neutrons are created by 88Rb(EC,n)87Kr, which competes with 88Rb(EC)88Kr. The reason that neutron emission can occur relatively close to stability is that EC on 88Rb is predicted to occur through a relatively high lying excited state in 88Kr at Ex =6.9 MeV. This is a consequence of the proximity of the N = 50 neutron shell closure (88Rb has N = 51) resulting in spherically shaped nuclei and EC strength distributions that are concentrated in a few states
The first fusion reactions are initiated relatively early at = 1:2 1011 g cm 3 and e = 17:5 MeV (Fig. 11). Previously, 20O produced by EC processes from the initially abundant 20Ne, has been partially converted by neutron capture into 21O. As soon as 21O undergoes an EC transition to 21N, 21N+21O and 21N+21N fusion reactions occur. Slightly deeper at = 1:3 1011 g cm 3 and e=18.0 MeV, two EC transitions on the remaining 20O produce 20C, triggering 20C+20O, 20C+21N, and 20C+20C fusion reactions. Other fusion reaction combinations, including reactions involving 22O produced by neutron capture from 21O, also occur but are an order of magnitude weaker. At somewhat higher = 1:92 1011 g cm 3 and e = 20:4 MeV, the pycnonuclear fusion of oxygen becomes possible. 24O, produced 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 by electron captures from the initially present 24Mg, with some contribution from 21O neutron captures, is destroyed via 24O+24O. With this reaction, all oxygen is destroyed, leaving neon as the lightest element present in the crust.
At = 3:78 1011 g cm 3 and e = 25:2 MeV nuclei in most reaction chains have reached the neutron drip line (Fig. 11). The free neutron abundance is still low with Yn=1:1 10 13. This is su cient however to drive the composition into a (n, )-( ,n) equilibrium within each isotopic chain. Note that the neutron Fermi energy EFn kT at this stage. Overall, neutron capture reactions have significantly altered the composition as a function of mass number. In particular, abundances in most odd A chains have been drastically reduced, the only remaining odd A nucleus with a significant abundance is 89Cu (Section 4.1.2).
Beyond = 3:78 1011 g cm 3 and e = 25:2 MeV, SEC chains begin to play a role and rapidly convert nuclei along the neutron drip line into lighter species until a particularly strongly bound nucleus with a large EC threshold is reached (Fig. 12). The associated release of neutrons leads to a drastic 22 = 2:4 increase of the free neutron abundance, marking the location of neutron drip.
Neutron captures also drive the abundance in the neon isotopic chain, predominantly originating from initial 28Si in the burst ashes, into 32Ne and 34Ne. At = 7:7 1011 g cm 3, pycnonuclear fusion reactions set in and destroy 32Ne and 34Ne. The most important reactions are 34Ne+34Ne, 32Ne+34Ne, 34Ne+24O, and 34Ne+20C. 24O is produced via 32Ne(EC,n)31Na(EC,8n)23O(n, )24O. 20C is produced from 24O via 24O(EC,2n)22N(n, )23N(EC,5n)18C(2n, )20C.
All these processes are essentially completed at = 1:28 1012 g cm 3 and e = 33:6 MeV, at which point the composition is concentrated in a few nuclei at N = 82 (116Se, abundance Y=4:4 10 4), at N = 50 (70Ca Y=1:0 10 2, near N = 28 (46Si, Y=2:6 10 4), and at N = 28 (40Mg, Y=8:4 10 5). The neutron abundance has reached Yn = 0:21 (Fig. 7) and EFn has reached 0.62 MeV, exceeding kT 40 keV resulting in degenerate neutrons. The abundance accumulated at the three locations where the neutron drip line intersects the neutron numbers N = 28; 50, and 82 can be mapped to di erent mass ranges in the initial composition. N = 82 is mostly produced from initial A 106 nuclei, with some contribution from A = 102 105. The initial A 106 abundance is 7:5 10 4, already larger than the final N = 82 abundance. The main branch points that govern leakage to lighter nuclei for A 106 material are 106Kr and 104Se. At 106Kr, neutron capture moves material towards N = 82, while EC feeds 104Se via a (EC)( ,n)(EC,n) sequence. At 104Se, (EC,n) moves material ultimately to N = 50, while neutron capture feeds N = 82. The final N = 82 abundance may be increased by a small contribution from A = 102 105. The key branchings are 102Se and again 104Se, where in each case the EC branch moves the abundance towards N = 50.
A 56 nuclei are mostly converted into nuclei near the N = 28 region. A = 56 is the borderline case, and the reaction sequence is similar to the pure 56Fe case discussed in section 3.1. An isolated exception is the initial 28Si abundance which in part ends up in the N = 50 region due to fusion reactions: 28Si is converted into neon isotopes via ECs. At 28Ne neutron capture competes with 28Ne(EC,n). The 28Ne(EC,n) branch leads to fluorine and then oxygen, which then fuses into nuclei in the sulfur region. However, a significant fraction of the initial 28Si abundance is processed through the 28Ne(n, ) branch leading to neutron rich neon isotopes, which then fuse into calcium, and ultimately end up in 70Ca (N = 50). Initial elements lighter than silicon fuse into nuclei below calcium and are therefore converted into N 28 nuclei. Initial elements heavier than silicon but lighter than iron end up as magnesium or silicon isotopes, which do not fuse until much greater depths, when nuclei are su ciently neutron rich for SECs to prevent accumulation at N = 50. 42 40

We continue the simulation beyond = 1:25 1012 g cm 3 and e = 33:6 MeV to = 2:5 1012 g cm 3 and e = 37 MeV, at which point the increasing neutron density drives the composition towards the edge of our reaction network. At = 2 1012 g cm 3 and e = 35:1 MeV N = 50 70Ca is destroyed by a SEC and converted into nuclei in the N = 28 region, leaving only the N = 28 and N = 82 regions with significant abundance. We also see the onset of significant 40Mg+40Mg fusion, resulting in a similar fusion-SEC cycle as discussed in section 3.1.
Fig. 14 shows the calculated time integrated nuclear energy production. The various drops indicate significant cooling from nuclear Urca pairs in the outer crust. Indeed, the location of the top three pairs listed in Tab. 2 coincides with the major drops visible in Fig. 14 around = 2:2 1010 g cm 3, = 3:2 1010 g cm 3, and = 6:4 1010 g cm 3. ) u / V e ( 1 M y g r e n e ra0 e l c u n -1109
A more typical estimate of the final composition of mixed H/He bursts is provided by calculations using the 1D multizone code KEPLER. We use the model described in more detail in
The evolution of the composition with increasing depth is overall very similar to the extreme rp-process ashes case, though the di erent mass chains have di erent relative abundances due to the di erent initial composition (Fig. 16). The main global di erence is a shift of the appearance of significant amounts of free neutrons towards higher densities by about 50%, which is more in line with the calculation for pure 56Fe ashes (Fig. 7). This is due to the much reduced abundance of heavy (A > 72) nuclei that tend to reach the neutron drip line at shallower depth and lead to an early release of neutrons in the case of the extreme rp-process ashes. The deeper onset of neutron drip has some consequences for the further evolution of the composition. In particular, when the heavier mass chains reach the neutron drip line, the neutron abundance is lower, and the equilibrium nucleus is therefore closer to stability where electron capture thresholds are lower. SEC cascades therefore set in earlier, compared to the case of extreme rp-process ashes where nuclei are pushed to more neutron rich isotopes that require higher e to capture electrons (Fig. 17). This, together with the much lower initial abundance of A > 103 nuclei leads to a negligible production of N = 82 nuclei. The final composition after SECs have converted the composition into nuclei at or near closed shells or with large single particle energy level gaps is 70Ca (N = 50, Y =8:5 10 3), 46Si (N = 32, Y =1:24 10 3), and 40Mg (N = 28, Y =6:4 10 3) with a neutron abundance of Yn = 0:092.
Again we can map these final abundances to the distribution by mass number of the initial composition. As in the case of the extreme rp-process ashes, A 56 is the approximate dividing line between material ending up in N = 50 and near N = 28. However, because of the lower free neutron abundance nuclei tend to be less neutron rich and have lower EC thresholds. Therefore, in the case of the KEPLER X-ray burst ashes, there is some leakage from the A = 58 60 mass chains towards the N = 28 region, primarily due to branch points where neutron capture competes with EC such as 59Ca(EC),60Ca(EC,n), and 62Ca(EC,3n). While the abundance that remains in the Ca isotopic chain is ultimately converted into N = 50 70Ca, any leakage to lighter elements feeds the N = 28 region. As in the case of the extreme rpprocess ashes, the initial 28Si abundance is fed into the Ca isotopic chain and converted to 70Ca. Indeed, the sum of the initial abundances of 28Si and A > 60 is 9:5 10 3 mol/g exceed the produced N = 50 abundance slightly, indicating that most of the other nuclei end up near N = 28.
At depths beyond = 1:10 1012 g cm 3 (y = 1:27 1016 g cm 2) the evolution is essentially the same as in the case of the extreme rp-process ashes (see section 3.2). The nuclear energy release is overall similar (Fig. 14), though there is somewhat stronger nuclear Urca cooling, and a slightly higher nuclear energy generation. The dominant 36 Urca pairs are listed in Tab. 3. Compared to the extreme rpprocess ashes there are two additional important Urca pairs in lighter mass chains, 33Al-33Mg and 65Fe-65Mn. The lack of shallower cooling from heavier nuclei is more than o set by the very strong cooling from 31Mg-31Na at around = 1 1011 g cm 3 (Fig. 14). This is due to the much larger initial abundance of A = 31 nuclei (9:1 10 5 vs 4:9 10 6).
In some X-ray bursting systems, rare superbursts may further modify the composition at a depth around = 1 109 g cm 3
The final composition shown in Fig. 20 has been determined at the same e as Fig. 17 and demonstrates that in10-1 deed the same nuclei are populated. Because this composition is reached at a greater depth, it is much closer to the onset of pycnonuclear fusion of 40Mg. However, the relative population of 40Mg (Y=9:1 10 3), 46Si (Y=8:7 10 3), and 70Ca (Y=3:2 10 4) is di erent because of the di erent initial composition. Most of the abundance is concentrated around N = 28 with only a smaller N = 50 contribution from 70Ca. Because the initial composition has only a small amount of A > 60 nuclei (Y=8 10 8 mol/g), the only contribution to N = 50 comes from parts of the initial A = 60 and A = 28 abundances (see discussion in section 3.2). Again the competition of neutron capture and EC at 60Ca and 28Ne, respectively, is critical in determining the relative distribution of N = 28 and N = 50 nuclei in the inner crust.
In crusts with initial superburst ashes, Urca cooling is comparable to the case of extreme rp-process ashes (Fig. 14), however, cooling comes almost exclusively from the 55Sc55Ti pair. All other Urca cooling pairs are at least a factor of 50 weaker. Heating is significantly higher than for either of the X-ray burst ashes cases.
The reaction sequences obtained here with a full reaction network di er substantially from previous work, especially when compared to models that consider only a single species at a given time such as
In the case of the initial 56Fe ashes, we agree with
The onset of pycnonuclear fusion also di ers. In
A fundamental di erence here is that we do not find a large abundance buildup of the fusion reaction products as found in
The reaction sequences starting with broader initial composition distributions are of similar type, characterized by 4 phases - EC chains without neutrons, EC chains with neutron-induced reactions, SECs at neutron drip, and pycnonuclear fusion. As soon as neutrons are released, the evolution in a given isobaric EC chain starts to depend on what happens in other chains. Initial abundances of lighter species such as 20Ne, 24Mg, or 28Si are transformed into even lighter nuclei, which then undergo pycnonuclear fusion prior to neutron drip. This has already been suggested by
Here the fusion reaction rates determine how rapidly nuclei are converted into free neutrons.
Nuclear Urca cooling has been discussed in detail in
The situation for the 55Ti $ 55Sc pair is less clear. One of the key prerequisites for a strong Urca cycle in an odd A chain is a strong allowed ground state to ground state (or within a few 10 keV of the ground state) EC and transition. Experimental studies of the ground state of 55Ti indicate a spin and parity of 1/2
For ashes from regular X-ray bursts that produce a wider range of nuclei, additional strong nuclear Urca pairs can be populated. For KEPLER X-ray burst ashes, the dominant cooling comes from the 31Mg $ 31Na pair (Tab. 3). This pair had also been identified in
For our calculation with the ashes of an extreme X-ray burst, the production of A > 100 nuclei opens up a number of additional possible Urca cooling pairs (Tab. 2), the strongest of which had already been identified in
The strongest Urca cooling pairs identified here are located at depths in the range of = 3:5 109 g cm 3 to = 1:1 1011 g cm 3. Pairs at shallower depths are considerably weaker, though they may still be important in limiting the strong shallow heating that is indicated by observations of cooling transients and superburst ignition depths
We find that free neutrons start to play a role long before the composition reaches the neutron drip line, the traditional point where free neutrons appear. This early release of neutrons stems from EC reactions that populate neutron unbound excited states (Ex > S n), which then decay by neutron emission. There are two basic mechanisms for EC to populate high lying excited states. First, the EC threshold of a particular reaction may be increased by the excitation energy of the lowest lying daughter state for an allowed transition. If this state is above the neutron separation energy, neutron emission will occur. Also, once the transition proceeds at threshold, e can be higher than the threshold of the subsequent EC reaction, leading again to the population of excited daughter states that may be above the neutron separation energy. These e ects can occur in even and odd A chains. An example is 88Rb(EC,n)87Kr discussed in section 3.2, where the lowest lying EC transition is predicted to go to a 6.9 MeV state in 88Kr, close to S n(88Kr) = 7:02 MeV. This leads to neutron emission relatively close to stability. It will be important to explore how lower lying forbidden transitions not included in the QRPA-fY calculations may reduce this e ect.
The second mechanism to release neutrons prior to reaching the neutron drip line is the odd-even staggering of QEC in even A chains, QEC = jQEC;even even QEC;odd oddj. In these chains, an EC reaction on an even-even nucleus is immediately followed by an EC reaction on an odd-odd nucleus
The early release of neutrons does not lead to a buildup of a large free neutron abundance. Instead, the released neutrons are recaptured by other nuclei present at the same depth. This is a feature of the multi-component composition of the outer crust. Nuclei with the largest abundance and largest neutron capture cross sections will dominate the neutron absorption. Interestingly this tends to lead to the depletion of odd A chains, starting as early as at = 4 1010 g cm 3 (see Fig. 21). As the odd A mass chains tend to have most of the nuclear Urca pairs, the early release of neutrons strongly limits Urca cooling in the deeper regions of the outer crust. ) g / le10-3 o m ( e c n da10-4 n u b a A dd10-5 o 1e+09 1e+10 1e+11 mass density (g/cm3) 1e+12
The e required for pre-drip line neutron release varies greatly from mass chain to mass chain. To illustrate this point, we provide a simple estimate for the minimum e for neutron release in each mass chain, based on nuclear mass di erences ( e > jQECj + S n) (Fig. 22). EC transitions are assumed to proceed when e > jQECj + Ex0, with Ex0 being the daughter excitation energy of the lowest lying EC transition. This simple estimate neglects lattice energy and finite temperature corrections, which depend on overall composition and astrophysical parameters and are included in the full network calculation. Clearly, the depth of early neutron release depends strongly on the mass chain and therefore on the initial composition created by thermonuclear burning on the neutron star surface. While transitions into excited states move the release of neutrons to shallower depths, on average by 6 MeV in e (red solid line in Fig. 22), the odd-even staggering of QEC alone leads to significant neutron release (red dashed line in Fig. 22) prior to reaching the neutron drip line (blue line in Fig. 22). All curves in Fig. 22 show a pronounced variation in e from mass chain to mass chain of up to about 10 MeV. Therefore, regardless of the detailed transition energies and odd-even staggering, there will be a transition region between the outer and inner crust where some mass chains release neutrons, and others capture them. The characteristics of the compositional evolution in this region will depend sensitively on the composition of the X-ray burst ashes.

In agreement with
In the SEC mechanism, EC with neutron emission drives the composition away from the neutron drip line towards lower EC thresholds. EC reactions can then become faster than neutron capture reactions and another EC reaction follows immediately, before neutron capture can restore (n, )( ,n) equilibrium in the isotopic chain. If the subsequent EC reaction again leads to neutron emission, the sequence can repeat many times, greatly accelerating the conversion of heavier elements into lighter ones.
An example is the SEC sequence shown in Fig. 5 for the initial 56Fe composition. For the neutron density and temperature at the location shown, the dominant (n, )-( ,n) equilibrium abundance in the Z = 14; 17; 18 isotopic chains would be N = 34; 44, and 44, respectively. Yet, EC occurs significantly closer to stability at N = 28, 34每36, and 38每42, respectively. Clearly the reaction sequence is o equilibrium and the competition of EC and neutron capture rates, as well as the number of neutrons emitted following an EC are important. On the other hand, in the Z = 15, and 16 isotopic chains, neutron captures drive the composition back to equilibrium following the EC-induced neutron emission. Nevertheless the cascade continues, as the EC thresholds of the equilibrium nuclei are lower than the current e. Fig. 12 shows a similar mix of EC reactions o equilibrium (immediately following a preceding EC reaction) and in equilibrium (EC reactions followed by neutron capture). The reaction sequences driving the composition to lower Z can therefore be quite complex and depend on QEC, S n, the feeding of states above S n in EC transitions, and neutron capture rates.
The FRDM mass model includes shell e ects that have a significant impact on the composition in the inner crust. The term §shell e ect§ refers here to the occurrence of large energy gaps in neutron or proton single particle levels in some nuclei. We emphasize that this is not limited to closed shell nuclei, where the term ※shell§ refers to the highly degenerate set of levels that occur only in nuclei with spherical shape
These energy gaps give rise to additional nuclear binding and thus can, as we show, prevent the formation of a single species composition at neutron drip. Instead, depending on the initial composition, abundance peaks form where the N = 28; 50, and 82 shell e ects coincide with the neutron drip line. This can have a strong impact on thermal conductivity in the inner crust (section 4.3). We find that initial A 56 nuclei (but not A = 28) end up feeding N 28, initial 60 < A 105 and A = 28 nuclei feed N = 50, and initial A 106 nuclei feed mostly N = 82. A = 56每60 and A =102每 106 are borderline areas, where branchings lead to feeding of two di erent final mass regions. The exact split depends on neutron abundance and competing reaction rates.
It is therefore important to understand the composition of the X-ray burst ashes, in particular the amount of 28Si and A 102 nuclei.
The amount of A 102 nuclei produced in X-ray bursts is still an open question.
Another important question is whether the shell e ects for nuclei near the neutron drip line predicted by the FRDM exist. In particular, the production of N = 82 nuclei is strongly facilitated by the interplay of predicted masses and spherical shell closure induced shape changes of neutron rich nuclei around Z = 38 and N = 70每82. An increase in S n with increasing neutron number in this mass region leads to a jump of the (n, )-( ,n) equilibrium nucleus to N = 82. This is the same e ect that leads to an underproduction of nuclei below A = 130 in the rapid neutron capture process
It has been pointed out that calculations based on some self-consistent Hartree-Fock Bogolubov and Relativistic Mean Field models predict a weakening of the spherical shell gaps far from stability (see, for example,
For the relevant N = 50 and N = 82 nuclei 70Ca (N = 50) and 116Se (N = 82) the FRDM predicts spherical shell closures. However, these nuclei are currently out of experimental reach and neither has been observed in laboratory experiments. The most proton deficient N = 50 nucleus studied so far is 78Ni. Measurements of -decay half-lives of 78Ni and nearby isotopes indicate strong spherical shell closures at Z = 28 and N = 50
Heating and cooling by nuclear reactions in the crust links the nuclear processes identified in this work with observables. Fig. 14 shows that the considerably di erent nuclear processes obtained with a full reaction network and a realistic initial multi-component composition lead to di erences in the heating and cooling of the neutron star crust compared to simplified single component equilibrium calculations
There are also significant di erences in heating between the models. This is shown in Fig. 23, where we only integrate over segments of positive slope in Fig. 14. This provides a lower limit of the heating, as we neglect any heating during a cooling episode. On one hand, all our calculations with a full reaction network show significantly more heating at shallower depths than the
The much shallower onset of fusion reactions in the models with realistic ashes, around = 1:2 7:7 1011 g cm 3, compared to = 1:1 1012 g cm 3 for pure 56Fe ashes, contributes to an increased heat deposition at shallower depths. This is due to two e ects. First, lighter nuclei in the initial composition tend to be converted more rapidly into the low Z species that can undergo fusion reactions. Second, the superthreshold electron capture cascade (SEC) e ect creates lighter nuclei earlier.
Despite these di erences in the distribution of heat deposition, the total heat deposited is remarkably similar for all our models, at least down to a depth where = 1:6 1012 g cm 3. At that depth, total heat deposition is 1:1 MeV u 1, 0:96 MeV u 1, 0:88 MeV u 1, 1:2 MeV u 1 and 0:9 MeV u 1 for HZ08, pure Fe ashes, extreme burst ashes, KEPLER burst ashes, and superburst ashes, respectively. Note however, that the latter three cases are lower limits, as some heat may be released in regions with net cooling. Our results confirm with a full reaction network the robustness of heating (but not Urca cooling) in respect to initial composition found in previous work using simplified approaches
We are now in the position to predict the impurity parameter Qimp = Pi Yi(Zi hZi)2= Pi Yi with average charge number hZi and abundances Yi (excluding neutrons) as a function of depth. Qimp is important as it determines the thermal conductivity of the crust due to electron impurity scattering. Fig. 24 shows impurity parameters for the various initial compositions as a function of density. The extreme X-ray burst ashes exhibit the broadest range of isotopes and has the largest Qimp 80. The rp-process in the more typical KEPLER burst produces much fewer Z = 30 46 nuclei resulting in a lower initial Qimp 40. Superbursts drive the composition into nuclear statistical equilibrium, resulting in much less diverse ashes with a much smaller initial Qimp 4. Down to a depth where = 1 1010 g cm 3, Qimp stays rather constant. At greater depth it begins to decrease substantially because heavier nuclei tend to electron capture more, reducing their Z faster, and because the early release of neutrons starts to eliminate abundance in some mass chains. At = 1 1011 g cm 3, the extreme burst ashes shows a drastic reduction in Qimp bringing it in line with the KEPLER ashes. This is due to the pycnonuclear fusion of oxygen produced via electron capture from the relatively large initial 20Ne abundance. In addition, compared to the KEPLER ashes, the extreme burst ashes has relatively smaller initial abundances of 24Mg and 28Si, causing a much larger impact on Qimp once lighter nuclei from the abundance 20Ne start fusing. Between = 2 1011 g cm 3 and = 7 1011 g cm 3, light element fusion and SEC chains lead to a steady reduction in Qimp for all cases.
Interestingly, all initial compositions converge to a comparable Qimp =7-11 between = 8 1011 g cm 3 and = 1:3 1012 g cm 3 due to shell e ects that lock abundance in di erent locations. This includes even the pure 56Fe ashes, which turns into a multi-component composition beyond neutron drip due to the splitting of the reaction path discussed in section 3.1. However, beyond = 1:5 1012 g cm 3 material trapped at the N = 50 spherical shell closure is destroyed and all compositions but the extreme burst ashes converge to a single nucleus and Qimp drops to less than one. This is in line with previous predictions
Our theoretical predictions of Qimp can be compared with constraints extracted from observed cooling curves of transiently accreting neutron stars using crust cooling models. For KS1731-260, the most recent analysis by

Most crust cooling models used to analyze observational data employ a single Qimp for the entire crust. These Qimp values can be compared to our predictions at > 1012 g/cm3 where electron-impurity scattering is expected to dominate heat transport
The observational constraints of a small inner crust Qimp in most sources overall agree with our predictions for KEPLER burst and superburst ashes, but clearly disagree with our prediction for extreme rp-process ashes. Our finding of a high Qimp = 20 for an initial composition from extreme rpprocess ashes could in principle explain the high Qimp = 40 inferred for EXO 0748-676
It has been suggested, that chemical separation e ects during the freezing of the crust at the ocean crust boundary, which are not included in our model, lead to a reduction in Qimp in the outer crust
We identify the typical nuclear reaction sequences in the crust of accreting neutron stars down to a depth where = 2 1012 g cm 3 using a full reaction network for a range of initial compositions. Significant di erences are found from calculations using the single nuclear species approximation or equilibrium considerations, including Urca cooling, already reported in
The location of neutron drip and the buildup of a free neutron abundance depend on the initial composition. Traces of free neutrons (abundance > 10 18) begin to occur in the = 3每5 1011 g cm 3 range and continue to increase with depth. Significant (> 1 %) free neutron abundances are established between = 6 1011 g cm 3 and = 1 1012 g cm 3.
While the total nuclear heating to the depth explored in our work is similar to previous simpler estimates, and rather independent of initial composition, the deposited heat distribution can di er substantially. A significant shallow heat source is required to explain observations of cooling transients
Our calculations confirm previous predictions that large initial crust impurity is reduced when transitioning from the outer crust (shallower than neutron drip) to the inner (deeper than neutron drip) crust
We find Qimp = 20 in the inner crust if the initial composition contains significant amounts of A 102 nuclei (for example, our extreme rp-process ashes). Such a high Qimp is incompatible with observational constraints for KS1731260, MXB1659-29, and XTE J1701-462. Either shell e ects vanish for extremely neutron rich nuclei, or these systems do not contain A 102 nuclei in the outer crust. In general, shell e ects are not expected to disappear on approaching the neutron drip line though. For example, while covariant density functional theory predicts the disappearance of the N = 50 shell gap at the neutron drip line, it also predicts the emergence of a new N = 40 shell gap and the persistence of a significant, though somewhat weakened, N = 82 shell gap
The high Qimp found for extreme rp-process ashes is of comparable order of magnitude to the analysis of
To date, crust cooling models mostly employ a single Qimp throughout the crust. It would be interesting to explore the impact of the more realistic Qimp profile predicted in this work. Any sensitivity, for example to impurities in the deeper layers of the outer crust, would provide interesting constraints on the outer crust composition that could then be brought to bear on our understanding of the hydrogen and helium burning processes during prior outbursts.
This work is a first step in identifying the critical nuclear physics inputs for models of accreted neutron star crusts. We delineate the types of nuclear reactions and the typical nuclear element and mass regions involved. Future work is needed to vary the nuclear physics input and determine the sensitivity of observables to nuclear physics. It is clear that nuclear masses play a critical role, in particular, the relative locations of contours of S n and QEC across the chart of nuclides near the neutron drip line (and the location of the neutron drip line itself), and deviations from smooth trends in the mass surface, for example, shell e ects, around the neutron drip line. In particular, the FRDM shell e ects in neutronrich N 50 and N 82 nuclei that cause neutron captures in the r-process to sweep abundance rapidly into the closed neutron shell resulting in the underproduction of nuclei below the A = 130 and A = 195 abundance peaks
Improved electron capture and decay strength functions are also needed 每 key elements are the ground state to ground state strength that determines the degree of nuclear Urca cooling in the outer crust, and the location of the lowest lying strength that plays a role in early neutron emission and heat deposition. In this context, the role of forbidden transitions, which especially near spherical shell closures can be the lowest-lying strength are important, and more work on models for forbidden transitions is desirable. One important question relates to the low lying and EC transitions in the 55Sc $ 55Ti Urca pair, which is the only strong Urca cooling pair found in this study for systems that exhibit superbursts. The treatment of EC and induced neutron emission should also be improved taking into account neutron decay strength distributions and the corresponding density dependent Pauli blocking through the degenerate free neutrons.
The predicted rates of pycnonuclear fusion and neutron capture are highly uncertain. For example, while the assumptions of the underlying nuclear model used to calculate the S-factors have been confirmed experimentally
It should also be noted that the initial composition, and therefore the nuclear physics of hydrogen and helium burning, either in X-ray bursts or in steady state burning, is important.
In principle, our calculations can serve as a starting point for an iterative process to determine the crust temperature profile that is consistent with the calculated heating and cooling, similar to

The reaction sequences obtained here with a full reaction network di er substantially from previous work, especially when compared to models that consider only a single species at a given time such as
In the case of the initial 56Fe ashes, we agree with
The onset of pycnonuclear fusion also di ers. In
A fundamental di erence here is that we do not find a large abundance buildup of the fusion reaction products as found in
The reaction sequences starting with broader initial composition distributions are of similar type, characterized by 4 phases - EC chains without neutrons, EC chains with neutron-induced reactions, SECs at neutron drip, and pycnonuclear fusion. As soon as neutrons are released, the evolution in a given isobaric EC chain starts to depend on what happens in other chains. Initial abundances of lighter species such as 20Ne, 24Mg, or 28Si are transformed into even lighter nuclei, which then undergo pycnonuclear fusion prior to neutron drip. This has already been suggested by
Here the fusion reaction rates determine how rapidly nuclei are converted into free neutrons.
Nuclear Urca cooling has been discussed in detail in
The situation for the 55Ti $ 55Sc pair is less clear. One of the key prerequisites for a strong Urca cycle in an odd A chain is a strong allowed ground state to ground state (or within a few 10 keV of the ground state) EC and transition. Experimental studies of the ground state of 55Ti indicate a spin and parity of 1/2
For ashes from regular X-ray bursts that produce a wider range of nuclei, additional strong nuclear Urca pairs can be populated. For KEPLER X-ray burst ashes, the dominant cooling comes from the 31Mg $ 31Na pair (Tab. 3). This pair had also been identified in
For our calculation with the ashes of an extreme X-ray burst, the production of A > 100 nuclei opens up a number of additional possible Urca cooling pairs (Tab. 2), the strongest of which had already been identified in
The strongest Urca cooling pairs identified here are located at depths in the range of = 3:5 109 g cm 3 to = 1:1 1011 g cm 3. Pairs at shallower depths are considerably weaker, though they may still be important in limiting the strong shallow heating that is indicated by observations of cooling transients and superburst ignition depths
We find that free neutrons start to play a role long before the composition reaches the neutron drip line, the traditional point where free neutrons appear. This early release of neutrons stems from EC reactions that populate neutron unbound excited states (Ex > S n), which then decay by neutron emission. There are two basic mechanisms for EC to populate high lying excited states. First, the EC threshold of a particular reaction may be increased by the excitation energy of the lowest lying daughter state for an allowed transition. If this state is above the neutron separation energy, neutron emission will occur. Also, once the transition proceeds at threshold, e can be higher than the threshold of the subsequent EC reaction, leading again to the population of excited daughter states that may be above the neutron separation energy. These e ects can occur in even and odd A chains. An example is 88Rb(EC,n)87Kr discussed in section 3.2, where the lowest lying EC transition is predicted to go to a 6.9 MeV state in 88Kr, close to S n(88Kr) = 7:02 MeV. This leads to neutron emission relatively close to stability. It will be important to explore how lower lying forbidden transitions not included in the QRPA-fY calculations may reduce this e ect.
The second mechanism to release neutrons prior to reaching the neutron drip line is the odd-even staggering of QEC in even A chains, QEC = jQEC;even even QEC;odd oddj. In these chains, an EC reaction on an even-even nucleus is immediately followed by an EC reaction on an odd-odd nucleus
The early release of neutrons does not lead to a buildup of a large free neutron abundance. Instead, the released neutrons are recaptured by other nuclei present at the same depth. This is a feature of the multi-component composition of the outer crust. Nuclei with the largest abundance and largest neutron capture cross sections will dominate the neutron absorption. Interestingly this tends to lead to the depletion of odd A chains, starting as early as at = 4 1010 g cm 3 (see Fig. 21). As the odd A mass chains tend to have most of the nuclear Urca pairs, the early release of neutrons strongly limits Urca cooling in the deeper regions of the outer crust. ) g / le10-3 o m ( e c n da10-4 n u b a A dd10-5 o 1e+09 1e+10 1e+11 mass density (g/cm3) 1e+12
The e required for pre-drip line neutron release varies greatly from mass chain to mass chain. To illustrate this point, we provide a simple estimate for the minimum e for neutron release in each mass chain, based on nuclear mass di erences ( e > jQECj + S n) (Fig. 22). EC transitions are assumed to proceed when e > jQECj + Ex0, with Ex0 being the daughter excitation energy of the lowest lying EC transition. This simple estimate neglects lattice energy and finite temperature corrections, which depend on overall composition and astrophysical parameters and are included in the full network calculation. Clearly, the depth of early neutron release depends strongly on the mass chain and therefore on the initial composition created by thermonuclear burning on the neutron star surface. While transitions into excited states move the release of neutrons to shallower depths, on average by 6 MeV in e (red solid line in Fig. 22), the odd-even staggering of QEC alone leads to significant neutron release (red dashed line in Fig. 22) prior to reaching the neutron drip line (blue line in Fig. 22). All curves in Fig. 22 show a pronounced variation in e from mass chain to mass chain of up to about 10 MeV. Therefore, regardless of the detailed transition energies and odd-even staggering, there will be a transition region between the outer and inner crust where some mass chains release neutrons, and others capture them. The characteristics of the compositional evolution in this region will depend sensitively on the composition of the X-ray burst ashes.

In agreement with
In the SEC mechanism, EC with neutron emission drives the composition away from the neutron drip line towards lower EC thresholds. EC reactions can then become faster than neutron capture reactions and another EC reaction follows immediately, before neutron capture can restore (n, )( ,n) equilibrium in the isotopic chain. If the subsequent EC reaction again leads to neutron emission, the sequence can repeat many times, greatly accelerating the conversion of heavier elements into lighter ones.
An example is the SEC sequence shown in Fig. 5 for the initial 56Fe composition. For the neutron density and temperature at the location shown, the dominant (n, )-( ,n) equilibrium abundance in the Z = 14; 17; 18 isotopic chains would be N = 34; 44, and 44, respectively. Yet, EC occurs significantly closer to stability at N = 28, 34每36, and 38每42, respectively. Clearly the reaction sequence is o equilibrium and the competition of EC and neutron capture rates, as well as the number of neutrons emitted following an EC are important. On the other hand, in the Z = 15, and 16 isotopic chains, neutron captures drive the composition back to equilibrium following the EC-induced neutron emission. Nevertheless the cascade continues, as the EC thresholds of the equilibrium nuclei are lower than the current e. Fig. 12 shows a similar mix of EC reactions o equilibrium (immediately following a preceding EC reaction) and in equilibrium (EC reactions followed by neutron capture). The reaction sequences driving the composition to lower Z can therefore be quite complex and depend on QEC, S n, the feeding of states above S n in EC transitions, and neutron capture rates.
The FRDM mass model includes shell e ects that have a significant impact on the composition in the inner crust. The term §shell e ect§ refers here to the occurrence of large energy gaps in neutron or proton single particle levels in some nuclei. We emphasize that this is not limited to closed shell nuclei, where the term ※shell§ refers to the highly degenerate set of levels that occur only in nuclei with spherical shape
These energy gaps give rise to additional nuclear binding and thus can, as we show, prevent the formation of a single species composition at neutron drip. Instead, depending on the initial composition, abundance peaks form where the N = 28; 50, and 82 shell e ects coincide with the neutron drip line. This can have a strong impact on thermal conductivity in the inner crust (section 4.3). We find that initial A 56 nuclei (but not A = 28) end up feeding N 28, initial 60 < A 105 and A = 28 nuclei feed N = 50, and initial A 106 nuclei feed mostly N = 82. A = 56每60 and A =102每 106 are borderline areas, where branchings lead to feeding of two di erent final mass regions. The exact split depends on neutron abundance and competing reaction rates.
It is therefore important to understand the composition of the X-ray burst ashes, in particular the amount of 28Si and A 102 nuclei.
The amount of A 102 nuclei produced in X-ray bursts is still an open question.
Another important question is whether the shell e ects for nuclei near the neutron drip line predicted by the FRDM exist. In particular, the production of N = 82 nuclei is strongly facilitated by the interplay of predicted masses and spherical shell closure induced shape changes of neutron rich nuclei around Z = 38 and N = 70每82. An increase in S n with increasing neutron number in this mass region leads to a jump of the (n, )-( ,n) equilibrium nucleus to N = 82. This is the same e ect that leads to an underproduction of nuclei below A = 130 in the rapid neutron capture process
It has been pointed out that calculations based on some self-consistent Hartree-Fock Bogolubov and Relativistic Mean Field models predict a weakening of the spherical shell gaps far from stability (see, for example,
For the relevant N = 50 and N = 82 nuclei 70Ca (N = 50) and 116Se (N = 82) the FRDM predicts spherical shell closures. However, these nuclei are currently out of experimental reach and neither has been observed in laboratory experiments. The most proton deficient N = 50 nucleus studied so far is 78Ni. Measurements of -decay half-lives of 78Ni and nearby isotopes indicate strong spherical shell closures at Z = 28 and N = 50
Heating and cooling by nuclear reactions in the crust links the nuclear processes identified in this work with observables. Fig. 14 shows that the considerably di erent nuclear processes obtained with a full reaction network and a realistic initial multi-component composition lead to di erences in the heating and cooling of the neutron star crust compared to simplified single component equilibrium calculations
There are also significant di erences in heating between the models. This is shown in Fig. 23, where we only integrate over segments of positive slope in Fig. 14. This provides a lower limit of the heating, as we neglect any heating during a cooling episode. On one hand, all our calculations with a full reaction network show significantly more heating at shallower depths than the
The much shallower onset of fusion reactions in the models with realistic ashes, around = 1:2 7:7 1011 g cm 3, compared to = 1:1 1012 g cm 3 for pure 56Fe ashes, contributes to an increased heat deposition at shallower depths. This is due to two e ects. First, lighter nuclei in the initial composition tend to be converted more rapidly into the low Z species that can undergo fusion reactions. Second, the superthreshold electron capture cascade (SEC) e ect creates lighter nuclei earlier.
Despite these di erences in the distribution of heat deposition, the total heat deposited is remarkably similar for all our models, at least down to a depth where = 1:6 1012 g cm 3. At that depth, total heat deposition is 1:1 MeV u 1, 0:96 MeV u 1, 0:88 MeV u 1, 1:2 MeV u 1 and 0:9 MeV u 1 for HZ08, pure Fe ashes, extreme burst ashes, KEPLER burst ashes, and superburst ashes, respectively. Note however, that the latter three cases are lower limits, as some heat may be released in regions with net cooling. Our results confirm with a full reaction network the robustness of heating (but not Urca cooling) in respect to initial composition found in previous work using simplified approaches
We are now in the position to predict the impurity parameter Qimp = Pi Yi(Zi hZi)2= Pi Yi with average charge number hZi and abundances Yi (excluding neutrons) as a function of depth. Qimp is important as it determines the thermal conductivity of the crust due to electron impurity scattering. Fig. 24 shows impurity parameters for the various initial compositions as a function of density. The extreme X-ray burst ashes exhibit the broadest range of isotopes and has the largest Qimp 80. The rp-process in the more typical KEPLER burst produces much fewer Z = 30 46 nuclei resulting in a lower initial Qimp 40. Superbursts drive the composition into nuclear statistical equilibrium, resulting in much less diverse ashes with a much smaller initial Qimp 4. Down to a depth where = 1 1010 g cm 3, Qimp stays rather constant. At greater depth it begins to decrease substantially because heavier nuclei tend to electron capture more, reducing their Z faster, and because the early release of neutrons starts to eliminate abundance in some mass chains. At = 1 1011 g cm 3, the extreme burst ashes shows a drastic reduction in Qimp bringing it in line with the KEPLER ashes. This is due to the pycnonuclear fusion of oxygen produced via electron capture from the relatively large initial 20Ne abundance. In addition, compared to the KEPLER ashes, the extreme burst ashes has relatively smaller initial abundances of 24Mg and 28Si, causing a much larger impact on Qimp once lighter nuclei from the abundance 20Ne start fusing. Between = 2 1011 g cm 3 and = 7 1011 g cm 3, light element fusion and SEC chains lead to a steady reduction in Qimp for all cases.
Interestingly, all initial compositions converge to a comparable Qimp =7-11 between = 8 1011 g cm 3 and = 1:3 1012 g cm 3 due to shell e ects that lock abundance in di erent locations. This includes even the pure 56Fe ashes, which turns into a multi-component composition beyond neutron drip due to the splitting of the reaction path discussed in section 3.1. However, beyond = 1:5 1012 g cm 3 material trapped at the N = 50 spherical shell closure is destroyed and all compositions but the extreme burst ashes converge to a single nucleus and Qimp drops to less than one. This is in line with previous predictions
Our theoretical predictions of Qimp can be compared with constraints extracted from observed cooling curves of transiently accreting neutron stars using crust cooling models. For KS1731-260, the most recent analysis by

Most crust cooling models used to analyze observational data employ a single Qimp for the entire crust. These Qimp values can be compared to our predictions at > 1012 g/cm3 where electron-impurity scattering is expected to dominate heat transport
The observational constraints of a small inner crust Qimp in most sources overall agree with our predictions for KEPLER burst and superburst ashes, but clearly disagree with our prediction for extreme rp-process ashes. Our finding of a high Qimp = 20 for an initial composition from extreme rpprocess ashes could in principle explain the high Qimp = 40 inferred for EXO 0748-676
It has been suggested, that chemical separation e ects during the freezing of the crust at the ocean crust boundary, which are not included in our model, lead to a reduction in Qimp in the outer crust
We identify the typical nuclear reaction sequences in the crust of accreting neutron stars down to a depth where = 2 1012 g cm 3 using a full reaction network for a range of initial compositions. Significant di erences are found from calculations using the single nuclear species approximation or equilibrium considerations, including Urca cooling, already reported in
The location of neutron drip and the buildup of a free neutron abundance depend on the initial composition. Traces of free neutrons (abundance > 10 18) begin to occur in the = 3每5 1011 g cm 3 range and continue to increase with depth. Significant (> 1 %) free neutron abundances are established between = 6 1011 g cm 3 and = 1 1012 g cm 3.
While the total nuclear heating to the depth explored in our work is similar to previous simpler estimates, and rather independent of initial composition, the deposited heat distribution can di er substantially. A significant shallow heat source is required to explain observations of cooling transients
Our calculations confirm previous predictions that large initial crust impurity is reduced when transitioning from the outer crust (shallower than neutron drip) to the inner (deeper than neutron drip) crust
We find Qimp = 20 in the inner crust if the initial composition contains significant amounts of A 102 nuclei (for example, our extreme rp-process ashes). Such a high Qimp is incompatible with observational constraints for KS1731260, MXB1659-29, and XTE J1701-462. Either shell e ects vanish for extremely neutron rich nuclei, or these systems do not contain A 102 nuclei in the outer crust. In general, shell e ects are not expected to disappear on approaching the neutron drip line though. For example, while covariant density functional theory predicts the disappearance of the N = 50 shell gap at the neutron drip line, it also predicts the emergence of a new N = 40 shell gap and the persistence of a significant, though somewhat weakened, N = 82 shell gap
The high Qimp found for extreme rp-process ashes is of comparable order of magnitude to the analysis of
To date, crust cooling models mostly employ a single Qimp throughout the crust. It would be interesting to explore the impact of the more realistic Qimp profile predicted in this work. Any sensitivity, for example to impurities in the deeper layers of the outer crust, would provide interesting constraints on the outer crust composition that could then be brought to bear on our understanding of the hydrogen and helium burning processes during prior outbursts.

Improved electron capture and decay strength functions are also needed 每 key elements are the ground state to ground state strength that determines the degree of nuclear Urca cooling in the outer crust, and the location of the lowest lying strength that plays a role in early neutron emission and heat deposition. In this context, the role of forbidden transitions, which especially near spherical shell closures can be the lowest-lying strength are important, and more work on models for forbidden transitions is desirable.
